# Elderfiers Explained: 
# Advanced verifier nodes in the Fuego L1 Blockchain Network


## What Are Elderfiers?

**Elderfiers** are advanced verification nodes in the Fuego blockchain network that serve as on-chain input verifiers and distributed consensus participants. Think of them as specialized Eldernodes that help secure and verify transactions on the Fuego network, while providing additional services like cross-chain verification and enhanced security features.

## Key Characteristics

### 🔹 **Higher Tier Validators**
- Elderfiers are an enhanced version of basic Eldernodes
- Require an **800 XFG deposit stake** (versus 0 XFG for basic nodes)
- Operate with higher priority and enhanced capabilities

### 🔹 **On-Chain Verification**
- Validate transaction data cryptographically
- Generate verifiable proofs for blockchain operations
- Participate in a distributed consensus for critical network decisions

### 🔹 **Flexible Identity System**
- **Custom Names**: Use a custom 8-character only identifier (e.g., "FIRENODE")
- **Hashed Addresses**: Use cryptographic hash of public fee address for privacy
- **Standard Addresses**: Traditional wallet addresses starting with "fire"

### 🔹 **Advanced Consensus**
- ***Fast-Pass***: 2/2 consensus for quick verification.
- **Fall-Back**: 4/5 consensus for deeper verification consensus
- **Full-Quorum**: 8/10 consensus for fail-safe verification consensus
- Automatic  (if not 2 then 4)  between consensus modes

## What Do Elderfiers Do?

### 1. **Transaction Validation** 🔍
```
[Transaction] → [Elderfier Network] → [Cryptographic Verification] → [Approved/Rejected]
```
- Verify transaction integrity and authenticity
- Sign digital signatures and cryptographic proofs
- Enhance consensus thru good network uptime and strong sync performance

### 2. **Cross-Chain Operations** 🌉
- Enable secure bridges between different blockchains by validating cross-chain transactions (like HEAT bridge operations)
- Generate verification consensus signatures that are needed to verify zkSTARK proof 


### 3. **Consensus Participation** 🗳️
- Vote on network upgrades and protocol changes
- Participate in governance decisions
- Help resolve network conflicts through Elder Council voting
- **Email Inbox Interface**: Receive voting messages in an inbox-style system

### 4. **Enhanced Security** 🛡️
- Provide deposit-based security guarantees
- Monitor network for malicious activity
- Participate in slashing decisions for bad actors

## How Do Elderfiers Work?

### Deposit System (0x06 Tag Transactions)
```
1. Node operator deposits 800 XFG
2. Deposit is immediately unlocked but monitored
3. Spending triggers security validation
4. Misbehavior can result in slashing
```

### Consensus Mechanism
```
Fast Consensus (2/2):
  ├─ Elderfier A verifies transaction
  ├─ Elderfier B verifies transaction
  └─ Both agree → Transaction approved
    └─ Both split fee

Fallback Consensus (4/5):
  ├─ 5 Eldernodes participate
  ├─ Minimum 4 must agree
  └─ Majority consensus → Transaction approved
   └─ First 4 to sign same share fee

Full Quorum Consensus (8/10):
  ├─ 10 Eldernodes participate
  ├─ Minimum 8 must agree
  └─ Majority consensus → Transaction approved
   └─ First 8 to sign same share fee


```

### Security Window System
```
1. Transaction occurs
2. 8-hour security window opens
3. Network monitors for disputes
4. Window closes → Transaction finalized
```

Voting Options:

○ SLASH HALF - Burn half of Elderfier's stake  
○ SLASH NONE - Allow Elderfier to keep all stake
```

### 🔥 Slashing Outcomes (Where Does the Stake Go?)
When an Elderfier misbehaves (invalid signatures, extended downtime, security-window violations, etc.) its 800 XFG deposit is frozen and an Elder Council vote decides the outcome.

| Council Decision | What Happens to Deposit | Notes |
|------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| **SLASH ALL**    | 100 % of deposit is sent to the protocol’s irreversible **burn address** `fire11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111dead` | Coins are permanently removed from circulation. |
| **SLASH HALF**   | 50 % burned, 50 % returned to operator after the security window closes | Economic penalty but not total loss. |
| **SLASH NONE**   | 0 % burned, entire deposit unlocked after window closes | Reserved for minor or unproven infractions. |

A decision becomes final when the Elder Council voting inbox reaches quorum (2/2 fast-pass or 4/5 fallback).  Burn transactions are generated automatically by the daemon once quorum is reached.

## Conclusion

Elderfiers represent the next evolution of Fuego, combining economic incentive with cryptographic verification to create a more secure, efficient, and scalable network. If you're interested in earning rewards, contributing to network security expansion, or offering premium blockchain services, Elderfiers offer a compelling opportunity to participate in the future of Fuego.

By running an Elderfier you become part of an index of verifiers that are selected at random (potentially, weighted, by uptime) to participate in validation of network status, and therefore, are able to earn a share on fees from very specific types of transactions.  Fees on burn transactions, for example, are 0.8 XFG each large burn, and 0.0008 XFG from each standard burn. The Elderfiers participating in verification split once if 2/2 fastpass and spilt twice if fallback 4/5 is needed. Invalid signatures do not earn a share. The other transaction fee type is COLD deposits. COLD deposit *yield* rates, on the other hand, will be *managed* by COLDAO. By the way- this group of Elderfiers will essentially be the ones to set burn fees & determine deposit fees thru Elder Council voting, if so desired.  Either way, Elderfiers continue to earn fees in XFG.

Secure the Fuego blockchain while earning rewards & participating in Elder Council decisions that shape the network's future.
